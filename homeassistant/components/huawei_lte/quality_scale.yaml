    comment: Kind of done, but to be reviewed, there's probably room for improvement. Maybe address this when converting to use a data update coordinator. See also https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/55495

    comment: Most are trivially movable to translations, but some use numeric state ranges for selection (signal, bandwidth), and state selectors seem to apply only to enum like values.

    comment: The integration is async, but underlying huawei-lte-api is not.

    comment: Underlying huawei-lte-api does not use aiohttp or httpx, so not sure if we can do anything about this.
  strict-typing:
    status: todo
    comment: Integration is strictly typechecked already, and huawei-lte-api is in order. stringcase is not typed, and url-normalize as of 2.2.0 is missing the py.typed marker, https://github.com/niksite/url-normalize/pull/41
